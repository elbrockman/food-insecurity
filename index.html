        An estimated one in nine Americans are food insecure, totalling over 37
        million Americans.
      </p>
      <p data-dummytext="">
        Food insecurity is a lack of consistent access to enough food for an
        active, healthy life, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
        There are many adverse side effects from being food insecure,
        including iron deficiency, depression and anxiety, diabetes, chronic
        disease, and more. 
        
        <p> Lack of access to healthy food is a problem that affects every state and town in the United States. Kansas has a food insecurity rate of .127 with 368,770 people that are food insecure in the state according to Feeding America. Sara Hazen, the Coordinator at Cat’s Cupboard, said that the best solution to bring down food insecurity is to increase wages. “We need a living wage, it should be based on inflation so it should be state or city-based,” said Hazen. “That is my personal opinion.”

        Feeding America and Health Affairs collect the national food insecurity data. This data helps analyze and compare different states' food insecurity rates. One ongoing problem for rural areas that are food insecure is the proximity to the nearest grocery store. David Proctor, Co-Founder of the Rural Grocery Store Initiative, has seen first hand how rural communities are affected. "If you have no transportation, poor transportation, or if you're elderly and shouldn't be driving. Then the fact that we're a mobile society doesn't help you and, in fact, hurts you to have access to these foods," said Proctor.

Missouri leads with the highest food insecurity rates among adults and children in the states surrounding Kansas. Hazen said that she thinks the higher food insecurity rates in Missouri stem from the larger urban areas in the state. “Rural areas do suffer from food insecurity but I think St. Louis and Kansas City make up the larger portion of people that are food insecure which plays into the higher rate in Missouri,” said Hazen.

       In Kansas, about one in eight people and one in six children face hunger from food insecurity. The Staley School of Leadership Studies puts forth efforts each semester to help the food insecurity problem in Riley county, as it is one of the most food-insecure counties in Kansas. Hunter Hatfield, former Lead 212 student, said, "LEAD 212 was where I first learned about the food insecurity in Manhattan," said Hatfield. "We had a group that worked on a Cats For Cans project throughout the semester that helped collect canned food for the local community." </p>
      <p> Riley County has a 12.9 percent food insecurity rate and has the most food insecure direct amongst counties in Kansas. The Staley School of Leadership conducts 'Cats For Cans' each year to help benefit the local community and students are a large part of this event's success.
        <p>  While Riley County has high rates of food insecurity, the county does provide a lot of resources for those facing food insecurity. “I think it is impressive that every night of the week [in Riley County], someone has access to a meal through Common Table," said Hazen. Resources for those facing food insecurity in Kansas can be found <a href="https://nourishtogether.org/" target="_blank">here.</a>

        METHODOLOGY </p> 
       <p class= "data-description">
      </p> We reached out to Feeding America, and they gave us
        their most recent national food insecurity report. We gathered <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TV30oDuI3R-kZiCvu_r7OTMK3g3R86ByVyMBJQwHFpo/edit#gid=1506963499" target="_blank">data</a> from 2018
        because that is the most recent data they have available, as the data
        from two years ago influences how they approached food insecurity in
        2020. We analyzed the data in several different ways.
      
   <p class= "data-description">
     First, we compared
        the food insecurity rates and the amount of food insecure people between
        counties in Kansas.</p> 
      <p class= "data-description">Then, we wanted to focus more on Kansas and its
        states, so we created a bar graph to show how food insecure Kansas is
        compared to the states around it.</p> 
      <p class= "data-description">Lastly, we analyzed a map of the
        United States that showed every state’s food insecurity rate and amount
        of food insecure people in the state. We wanted to focus more on food
        insecurity in Kansas and compare it to national data, so we created
        graphics that focus on food insecurity in Kansas. Then we scoped it
        further out to see how Kansas is doing compared to other states.
